# neural-network-classifier
In this project, you will define pixel-based binary patterns for the letters A, B, and C, and use them as training data for your neural network. 
1. Introduction

This project implements a feedforward neural network (FNN) from scratch using NumPy. The task is to classify binary pixel patterns of letters A, B, and C. Instead of relying on deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, all key components such as weight initialization, forward propagation, activation functions, backpropagation, and gradient descent are implemented manually.
