# neural-network-classifier
In this project, you will define pixel-based binary patterns for the letters A, B, and C, and use them as training data for your neural network. 
1. Introduction

This project implements a feedforward neural network (FNN) from scratch using NumPy. The task is to classify binary pixel patterns of letters A, B, and C. Instead of relying on deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, all key components such as weight initialization, forward propagation, activation functions, backpropagation, and gradient descent are implemented manually.

This project provides hands-on experience in the foundations of neural networks:

Representing input data as vectors

Designing network architecture

Using activation functions (Sigmoid)

Implementing forward and backward propagation

Computing loss and updating weights

Visualizing performance (loss and accuracy)

2. Problem Statement

The model should:

Learn to classify letters A, B, and C from binary image patterns.

Optimize the model using backpropagation and gradient descent.

Visualize the learning process using loss and accuracy curves.

Predict and display the class of a given letter pattern using matplotlib.
